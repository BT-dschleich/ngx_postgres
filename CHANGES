    * Allow configuration of method-specific queries.

    * Restrict "postgres_pass" directive to "location" context.

    * Free keepalive connections on nginx shutdown.
      Requested by Yichun Zhang (agentzh).

    * Fix memory leak that was happening when nginx was configured
      to use non-existing database tables, etc.
      Found by Valgrind, reported by Yichun Zhang (agentzh).

2010-06-04
    * Use recently standardized error codes in RDS format.

2010-06-03
    * Allow request methods other than GET and HEAD.
      From Yichun Zhang (agentzh) via ngx_drizzle.

2010-05-12    VERSION 0.2
    * Add various improvements to build and testing infrastructures.
      Mostly done by Yichun Zhang (agentzh).

    * Put more restrictions on "postgres_pass" and "postgres_query"
      directives. Handle their bad configuration properly.

2010-05-10
    * Log PostgreSQL errors into error.log.
      Reminded by Yichun Zhang (agentzh).

2010-05-06
    * Remove connection timeout from re-used keepalive connection.

    * Fix libpq headers detection on Debian.
      Patch from Weibin Yao.

    * Add "postgres_get_value" directive.
      Requested by Johan Bergstroem.

    * Bring back fail-safe check that got lost during pre-release
      refactorization. Without this check performance was reduced
      few times under high load, because about 1% of keepalive
      connections got disconnected.

2010-05-05    VERSION 0.1
    * Initial release.
